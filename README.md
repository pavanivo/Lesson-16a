### Class 13/14: Natural Language Processing (NLP) 1 and 2

**NLP Resources:**
* If you want to learn a lot more NLP, check out the excellent [video lectures](https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture) and [slides](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/NLPCourseraSlides.html) from this [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp) (which is no longer being offered).
* This slide deck defines many of the [key NLP terms](https://github.com/ga-students/DAT_SF_9/blob/master/16_Text_Mining/DAT9_lec16_Text_Mining.pdf).
* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) is the most popular book for going in-depth with the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK).
* [A Smattering of NLP in Python](https://github.com/charlieg/A-Smattering-of-NLP-in-Python/blob/master/A%20Smattering%20of%20NLP%20in%20Python.ipynb) provides a nice overview of NLTK, as does this [notebook from DAT5](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT5/blob/master/notebooks/14_nlp.ipynb).
* [spaCy](http://spacy.io/) is a newer Python library for text processing that is focused on performance (unlike NLTK).
* If you want to get serious about NLP, [Stanford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) is a suite of tools (written in Java) that is highly regarded.
* When working with a large text corpus in scikit-learn, [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#vectorizing-a-large-text-corpus-with-the-hashing-trick) is a useful alternative to CountVectorizer.
* [Automatically Categorizing Yelp Businesses](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/09/automatically-categorizing-yelp-businesses.html) discusses how Yelp uses NLP and scikit-learn to solve the problem of uncategorized businesses.
* [Modern Methods for Sentiment Analysis](http://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/modern-methods-for-sentiment-analysis) shows how "word vectors" can be used for more accurate sentiment analysis.
* [Identifying Humorous Cartoon Captions](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dshahaf/pHumor.pdf) is a readable paper about identifying funny captions submitted to the New Yorker Caption Contest.
* [DC Natural Language Processing](http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/) is an active Meetup group in our local area.
* BM25 (a better tfidf) [takes document length into account when determining term importance](https://berlinbuzzwords.de/sites/berlinbuzzwords.de/files/media/documents/bm25_buzzwords_britta_weber.pdf)
